# AWS

#Prerequisites:
#1.	Download AWS tools for PowerShell from https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/ and install it.
#2.	Script will ask user AWS access and secret key to create resources on AWS so that user should have full access to create Key pair, RDS, Instances, Load Balancer.

#Run the PowerShell script WebApp.ps1 from that downloaded repository folder because script has dependency on the self certificates files. so run the script directly from the folder.
